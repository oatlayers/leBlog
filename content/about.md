I hope this doesn't come off as bragging. I make this page to provide a more detailed description of who I am. I hope you don't mind since you clicked this page anyway. Here it goes.

My name is Brilliant Keanu, I'm currently an engineering student in Indonesia. I was born in 2003. The things I do in my free time is watching YouTube and reading (be it articles, books, RSS feeds). I made this blog because I wanted to strengthen my web development skills as well as to provide a place for my essays. I like to write them because it helps me think.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I learnt so much. The most prominent were [Korean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXphO7BNuug), Coding, [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and learning how to edit on Adobe softwares. And not long before that I started reading everyday because I was bored. Right now I use moonreader+ and an old nook ereader to read. I have an old blogpost [here.](http://www.oatlayers.wordpress.com)

I believe that almost everything can be learnt online when one has enough dedication and diligence. I am trying to do that on things I'm passionate for. I hope this website has helped or entertained you in one way or another. Thank you for visiting.
