## Me in 1 minute
I make this page to provide a more detailed description of who I am. I care more about what I'm able to help and I refrain as much as possible to talk about myself. I hope you don't mind since you clicked this page anyway. Here it goes.

My name is Brilliant Keanu, I'm currently an engineering student in Indonesia. I was born in 2003. I spend too much of my time on YouTube and the rest I spend on reading. I made this blog because I wanted to strengthen my web development skills as well as to provide a place for my essays. I like to write them because it helps me think.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I learnt so much. The most prominent were [Korean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXphO7BNuug), Coding, [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and learning how to edit on Adobe softwares. And not long before that I started reading everyday because I was bored. Right now I use moonreader+ and an old nook ereader to read. I have an old blogpost [here.](http://www.oatlayers.wordpress.com)

I believe that almost everything can be learnt online when one has enough dedication and diligence. I am trying to do that on things I'm passionate for. I hope this website has helped or entertained you in one way or another. Thank you for visiting.

## Me in 5 minutes

**On economic development**
I was obsessed with economic development. Now, not so much but I'm still very eager to learn more on the subject. It fascinates me the ridiculous speed at which the East Asian economies were able to develop. Big cities sprung out of nowhere in China, railways and roads being built. And Japan during the late nineteenth century of how it modernized on its own with sheer volition and will. How Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea were able to industrialize capitalizing on export driven growth through value added goods. As of I'm writing this, Vietnam and Bangladesh are doing similar ways of developing their economy.

I have hundreds of research papers and journals as well as books on my Zotero repository. I have not been able to read all of them but I will when I have the time to do so. Economic development or how a country manages its economy and how it went bankrupt, or got rich is one of the things I'm really geeky for. I think this is because you can't escape economy. Almost all of the things around you has been influenced by it. And if you want to get people to be happy and independent, one of the best way (in my opinion THE best way) is to get them to be rich. This is far harder than it seems. Most people don't realize that half the world's population live in a developing economy while most poverty is only concentrated in sub saharan Africa (and even they are developing rather quickly). Because of this, finding a way of getting everyone to be rich is a very good goal. But I usually don't think that far anyway, I just like to see how each society and country get rich. Their stories are always interesting.

**On the human experience**
I like history, where we came from, what our current troubles are and where we're headed. The massive exponential growth of technology ever since the industrialization, what will be the endgame? Our civilization is continually evolving and expanding. The industrial revolution was a mere two centuries ago, and for the rest of the world, a mere decades. It isn't unreasonable to say that a farmer in rural China would have a son that would grow up to be an engineer, because their industrialization happened in just three decades. That to me, is mind boggling. Similar things are happening right now accross the world. I wonder where we will be headed as a species.

I really love other languages and cultures. Ever since I learnt another foreign language, I have always wanted to know more about how things are different in other regions of the world. The different customs, food, culture, music, traditions, beliefs etc. My first foreign language is English and I'm very grateful for it. It is the language of knowledge and the lingua franca of the world. If an Argentinian and an Indian person meets they will speak in English.

My second foreign language is Korean, I learnt this very recently. I have enough comprehension skills to understand things I watch and books that I read. I read mostly crime, mystery and horror novels so far. Korean was a rather odd choice because I initially want to learn Japanese given its more prominence in Indonesian society and how I want to understand how Japan modernized during the Meiji era. But I considered the language too difficult at the time hence me learning Korean.

Besides the culture, and I mean really the culture, I like to watch raw videos of vloggers eating ramyeon and going to traditional market in Busan and then cooking for neighborhoods type of content not just the big cities; I think you can just appreciate how there are so many ways of doing things and yours are not always the right thing. In light of what happened in August of 2021 in Afghanistan (not so long ago as of I'm writing this) I think we can learn a lot from that (I'm talking about America if you don't get it). So therefore I appreciate what my government is doing given what's going on in Myanmar after the coup, almost a predictable answer at this point when officials are asked by foreign media (mostly western) on what will Indonesia do given its position as a leader in ASEAN, that we will do our best to teach what is right without being too pretentious and not make enemies. Anyways I'm digressing too much here.

**On knowledge and life long learning**
I want to contribute to society in the ways I can. I think it helps give my life meaning. There are many problems that I've encountered that are easily solved with technology.

My life philosophy is currently almost all based on stoicism. A deep study of philosophy is one of the things I want to do. I want to read all the major text and figure out many ideas that great thinkers have contemplated in the past and present. I believe in freedom, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

I like reading, a lot. Sometimes there are moments where I would read a lot, sometimes I read more articles. Reading has been the most effective way to increase my vocabulary and I like that. Reading also feels like the author of the text and I is having a chat and I have to contemplate it, see what I think, and somehow being able to synchronize and harmonize it with the rest of my world views.

Sometimes there are these books or movies or articles that I think people just need to know more. I don't know if its particularly useful since everyone came from different backgrounds but there's this feeling that sometimes the content that I consume invoked on my emotion that I think people need to know it. Or maybe its just because I have no one in real life to talk to about it that could give any reasonable response beyond them not getting it. I hope you do, dear reader. I'll try to post and share as much as I can so just maybe there might be people sharing the same taste and views that I have in the future.
